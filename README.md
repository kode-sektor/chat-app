# Chat-app

## The aim of this project is build a light-weight real-time chat application using NodeJS, Socket.io and Express

** A few considerations for the app are listed below:

1. Prompt uses for their name before chatting
2. Indicate and manage when a message is in progress
3. Disable sent texts, enable and clear text after itâ€™s confirmed sent/received, error if not
4. Content/styling: my messages vs their messages, time of message, etc
